            <p>Osman I, also known as Osman Gazi (c. 1258 - c. 1323 CE), was the founder and first Sultan of the Ottoman Beylik, which would rise to eventually become the Ottoman Empire. He was the ruler of a small Turkic principality among many in the Anatolian region of Bithynia and, through a series of victories against the Byzantine Empire, would lay the foundation for his ancestors to build an empire spanning three continents, lasting centuries, and leaving its influence on the Middle East, Balkans, and the world.</p>
            <p >August 1071 CE, the Byzantine Empire was defeated by the Seljuk Turks under the command of Alp Arslan at the Battle of Manzikert. The defeat was a major strategic loss for the Byzantines in Anatolia, which opened the gates for its eventual conquest and colonization. The Seljuks were a confederation of ethnic Oghuz Turkic tribes, a nomadic people tracing their origins to the steppes of Central Asia and who had converted to Islam. The Seljuks had considerable success in Anatolia and the Middle East in the years following Manzikert, however, due to internal power struggles, conflicts with crusaders, and the emergence of the Mongol Ilkhanate, the Seljuks in Anatolia rebranded first into the Sultanate of Rum in 1081 CE and then fractured into several principalities known as Beyliks. And among those many Beyliks, was Osman's domain.</p>
